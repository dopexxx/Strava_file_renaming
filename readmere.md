Project goal:
- Collecting first experience in using Python to navigate on websites and analyze the HTML Code to do some simple things
- Renaming a bunch of rides in Strava

Project problem definition:
- Having a bunch of rides on Strava that have the same name ("Irchel Day", "Kombi Day"), I would like to rename all those rides according to the following regular expression: "ZÃ¼rich Commuting [DATE]".


Project pipeline:
1. Make yourself familiar with the python libraries that can be used to navigate on websites (JANNIK fragen?)
2. Navigate to Strava, to the Activities page
3. For all activities do:
	1. Check the title of the ride: If one of the above DO:
	2. Click on Edit the Ride
	3. Select the title section, delete current title
	4. Fill in replacing title according to the provided regExp
	5. Save the changed ride

GET STARTED:
pip install selenium

Navigate on pages? (i.e. if all rides on one side checked, do I need to click on the next page?)
